# Russian Facebook Ads

Examining the Facebook ads from the Russian "Internet Research Agency" (IRA)

On May 10, the Democrat's house of Intelligence published 3500 Facebook ads the IRA published on Facebook from 2015 to 2017. [Here's the data](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/facebook-ads/)

In the repo you'll find three notebooks:
1. Reading and pulling out the relevant information
2. Cleaning the data
3. Analysing and understanding the data

To run the notebooks download the files into the fs folder. [Here's how flatten folders](https://lifehacker.com/instantly-flatten-a-directory-in-os-x-with-a-terminal-c-1685729312) from the command line.

If anybody has time and the means to classify the targetted ads, please do get in touch. Or if you hae
